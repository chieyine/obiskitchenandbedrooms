    question: "Do you charge for the first visit?",
    answer:
      "No. The initial visit and consultation are free. We use it to understand your space, take rough measurements and talk through ideas and budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which areas do you cover?",
    answer:
      "We are based in Hertfordshire and regularly work in London, St Albans, Hemel Hempstead, Watford and surrounding areas—and we can travel further across the UK for larger jobs. Tell us your postcode and we'll confirm availability.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a typical project cost?",
    answer:
      "Every room is different, but most fitted wardrobes and smaller storage projects start from around the lower thousands, and full kitchens from a few thousand upwards. We'll always give you a clear written quote before any work begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does installation usually take?",
    answer:
      "Smaller wardrobe or storage installs can often be completed in 1–2 days. Kitchens and larger projects may take longer. We'll confirm timings once we've finalised your design.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove old wardrobes or cabinets?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can remove and dispose of old units as part of the project. We'll include this clearly in your quote so there are no surprises.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see examples of your previous work?",
    answer:
      "Yes, absolutely. You can view our recent projects in our Services section, and we're happy to show you more specific examples during a consultation.",
